## Features

- **Data Analysis**: Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand factors contributing to employee burnout.
- **Predictive Modeling**: Use linear regression to predict burnout levels based on various features.
- **Visualization**: Generate visualizations to illustrate findings and predictions.
- **Interactive Interface**: Provide an interface to input new data and get burnout predictions.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/employee-burnout-analysis.git
    cd employee-burnout-analysis
    ```

2. **Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):**
    ```bash
    python -m venv env
    source env/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `env\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3. **Install the required dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

1. **Run the analysis and prediction script:**
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```

2. **Using the Interface:**
    - **Load Data**: Load your dataset containing employee information and burnout levels.
    - **EDA**: Perform exploratory data analysis to understand the dataset.
    - **Train Model**: Train the linear regression model on the dataset.
    - **Predict**: Use the trained model to predict burnout levels for new data.
